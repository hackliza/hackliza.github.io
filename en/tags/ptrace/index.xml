      <description>Hi people.
 Today we are going to deepen an old technique that I have been studying. It is an attack to get sudo in case someone else is connected to the same machine with the same user and has sudo unlocked. This technique was already documented by nongiach in the sudo_inject repository. However, that implementation requires several files and dependences for the attack, so, in order to simplify it and learning about the technique, I have developed sudohunt.</description>
