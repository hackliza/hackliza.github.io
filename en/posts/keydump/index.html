Hi there!!</p>
<p>
Time ago I was tinkered with Linux <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyrings.7.html">keyrings</a> to extract Kerberos tickets from
keys with <a href="https://github.com/zer1t0/tickey">tickey</a>, and recently I was involved in a new interesting project in
which I needed to learn again about this topic, so I will try to describe the
important points here in case my future self or anyone else want to learn them.</p>
<p>
First we need to know is that Linux keyrings is a key management facility. The
keys are entities that can be used by programs to store secrets, like passwords
or certificates, in a secure way, preventing other programs or users from
accessing them.</p>
<p>
This been said, let&#39;s go to the topic!</p>
<div id="outline-container-the-beginning" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="the-beginning">
The beginning
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-the-beginning" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I was experimenting a little with sssd after reading about <a href="https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/linikatz">linikatz</a>
and then I found the following NOTE in the <code>krb5_store_password_if_offline</code>
option of the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/sssd-krb5">sssd-krb5</a> documentation:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">krb5_store_password_if_offline (boolean)
    Store the password of the user if the provider is offline and use it to request a TGT when
    the provider comes online again.

    NOTE: this feature is only available on Linux. Passwords stored in this way are kept in
    plaintext in the kernel keyring and are potentially accessible by the root user (with
    difficulty).

    Default: false</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
There are a few points here I would to discuss:</p>
<p>
First, and maybe the more important part is that <strong>passwords are stored in
plaintext</strong> in a kernel keyring. The documentation also points that this could be
accessible by root <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with difficulty</span>. But, what is difficulty? In my mind it
just means that a tool doesn&#39;t exists to do the job yet, so that is what I did.</p>
<p>
Another important fact is that passwords are only stored <strong><strong>when the provider is
offline</strong></strong>. In a common Active Directory (AD) scenario, this means that passwords
are only stored when the Domain Controller (DC) cannot be reached, therefore
making the attack less exploitable. However in case we are root of a machine, we
could force the machine to lost connection with the Domain Controller by
applying a firewall rule, for example, so we can collect the passwords of new
users that logs in the machine. However, for this purposes, maybe creating a fake PAM
module could be easier and more relayable approach. All this been said, I did it
anyway for the fun of a challenge.</p>
<p>
And last but not least, the default value of <code>krb5_store_password_if_offline</code> is
<code>false</code>. Which means that in absense of this option passwords are not
stored. However, by default <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/sssd">sssd</a> sets this option to <code>true</code>, so no problem at
all.</p>
<p>
Therefore, in order to extract the credentials, I required a tool able to
extract keyrings from other processes keyrings. As I said before, I did this in
the past by creating <a href="https://github.com/zer1t0/tickey">tickey</a>, but that tool was too focused on the kerberos
tickets. So I thought that I had to create a more generic tool to dump all the
keys of any process (or thread) keyrings, no matter the purpose.</p>
<p>
That is how <a href="https://github.com/zer1t0/keydump">keydump</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> was born. So in this post I will try to explain the concepts
behind keydump so we can understand its functionality.</p>
<p>
However, for those who are impatient, here is a preview of the keydump output
dumping a password stored by sssd process: </p>
<figure>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ps -o pid --no-headers -C sssd | sed &#39;s/ //g&#39; | sudo ./keydump -

</h2>
<div id="outline-text-the-problem" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So we want to dump the keys of other processes? The problem is that keys are
designed to avoid that.</p>
<p>
Keys can be created with permissions that will allow the only process (or even
thread) which creates the key to read it. In the case of sssd, we can see how
the key is created in the following line of the
<a href="https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/blob/077d2993a1b306e7cfe61618cbd5d03c602572f8/src/providers/krb5/krb5_delayed_online_authentication.c#L287">add_user_to_delayed_online_authentication</a> function:</p>

                                 KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING);</code></pre></div>
</div>
<figcaption>
sssd code to store a password into a key
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
To clarify, sssd is using a key that can only be accessed by processes its
current session (not a login session, but a <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=397655&amp;seqNum=6">process session</a> created with
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html">setsid</a>). Hence, we could the follow a similar approach to the one I used with
<a href="https://github.com/zer1t0/tickey">tickey</a>, by injecting a new process into that session by attaching us to ssdd
with <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</a> and forcing it to <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork</a> into a new process that will dump the keys
for us. However, in this occasion my approach will be to try to dump the keys
from the sssd process itself for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maybe in the future this is key is modified to only allow access from the same
process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extracting from the process itself will allow to reuse the tool to other
programs that only allow the same process to read the key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the real reason, I wanted to do it that way, and know if I could do it by
injecting a shellcode based in my <a href="https://github.com/zer1t0/shellnova">shellnova</a> project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&#39;s see how this can be done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like you to notice that in Linux, threads are implemented as lightweight
processes, and therefore each thread can have its own set of credentials. That
is the reason threads can have keys that are only accessed by themselves.</p>
<p>
This also means that injecting code in a thread is the same as injecting it
into a process, we just need to specify the TID (Thread ID) instead of PID in
the <code>ptrace</code> syscall. In fact, when we specify the PID, we are just specifying
the TID of the process main thread.</p>

<div id="outline-text-keyrings" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
First we need to know how to dump keys from a process. As I have mentioned,
keys are stored in kernel memory. In this section I will try to describe all the
relevant points for our purpose, but you can find more information on the
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyrings.7.html">keyrings manual page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that Linux keyrings are not the only keyring solution, but there are many
others like <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring/">GNOME Keyring</a>, that aren&#39;t managed by the Linux kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In order to read the contents of a key, we need to know its key ID, since it
is required to perform the <code>KEYCTL_READ</code> operation of the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/keyctl.2.html">keyctl syscall</a>. In our
case, we want to read all the keys a process can access, so how do we get their
IDs?</p>
<div id="outline-container-the-proc-keys-file" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="the-proc-keys-file">
The /proc/keys file
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-the-proc-keys-file" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Well, we just need to read the <code class="verbatim">/proc/keys</code> file, which is a pseudo-file in the
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html">proc filesystem</a> that returns the available keys for the process that reads
it. Here is an example:</p>

<div class="src src-text">

2729088e I--Q---     1 perm 1f3f0000  1000 65534 keyring   _uid_ses.1000: 1</code></pre></div>

<p>
As we can appreciate, there is a line per key, a very common format in the Unix
world. In each line we have several fields that describe a key. Let&#39;s review
them to properly understand them.</p>
<p>
In the first field we have the <strong>key ID</strong>, or serial number, that uniquely
identifies the key. This is the main piece of information we want to retrieve to
read the key contents, but let&#39;s also understand the other fields.</p>
<p>
The second field indicates <strong>state flags</strong> related to the keys. Here we need to
check that the key we want to read have the <code>I</code> flag, which means the key is
instanciate, that is, that the key has been created. This may sound weird, since
all the keys should be created to exists right? However keys can also be
requested and created by a third party, as described in <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/request_key.2.html">request_key(2)</a>, and
being in under construction state, indicated by the <code>U</code> flag.</p>
<p>
The third field, known as <strong>usage</strong>, indicates how many links point to the key. A
key can be pointed by a keyring, that is an special type of key that keeps links
that point to other keys, like a folder. If a key, even a keyring, lost all its
references, it is deleted. Due to this some keyrings, the anchor keyrings,
require a reference from kernel structures.</p>
<p>
The fourth field is the <strong>key timeout</strong>, and <code>perm</code> (permanent) keyword is
used to indicate that the key don&#39;t expire. An expired key cannot be used and it
will be deleted.</p>
<p>
The fifth field are the <strong>permissions</strong>, with four permission sets, a byte
per set (two hexadecimal digits), that refers to the possessor process or
thread, user, group and other permissions. The last 3 are similar to file
permissions sets, but the possessor set is more complicated and requires further
explanation, which I will provide below. Moreover, the permissions are different
than the ones of a file, and will also be explained below.</p>
<p>
Then we have the <strong>user and group</strong> ids of the key, that identifies the user and
group owner of a key (that is not the same as the possessor). A value of 65534
(-1 in signed integer) in the group field means the key has no group.</p>
<p>
The eighth field is the <strong>key type</strong>. There are several types of keys with
different characteristics, some of them even don&#39;t support the read operation so
its content cannot be retrieved (from userspace at least). Common types of
keys are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>user</strong> : A generic key that allows to store secrets completely in kernel
memory (payload up to 32767 bytes) and retrieve them from userspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>keyring</strong> : Contains links to other keys (even other keyrings). This is a very
special key type since works like a &#34;directory&#34; that allows keys to become
searchable by description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>logon</strong> : Like user type, but it doesn&#39;t allow read the secret payload from
user space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>big_key</strong> : Like user type, but it allows bigger secrets to be stored (up to
1 MiB). Therefore big keys may be stored encrypted in a tmpfs filesystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.kernel.org/crypto/asymmetric-keys.html"><strong>asymmetric</strong></a> : Allows to store public and private key pairs, or just public.
It doesn&#39;t allow reading the payload from userspace, but it provides
operations for encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify signature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more key types (like <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/bfa8f18691ed2e978e4dd51190569c434f93e268/certs/blacklist.c#L138">blacklist</a>, <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/bfa8f18691ed2e978e4dd51190569c434f93e268/crypto/asymmetric_keys/pkcs7_key_type.c#L70">pkcs7</a>, <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/bfa8f18691ed2e978e4dd51190569c434f93e268/fs/crypto/keyring.c#L173">.fscrypt</a>, etc) that I do
not list here cause I don&#39;t know its purpose, but in case you are curious, you
can discover them by searching for the use of the &#34;register_key_type&#34; function
in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">Linux kernel source code</a>.</p>
<p>
The final field is composed by two fields, the <strong>name or description</strong> of the key,
which can be used to search for the key in the keyrings, and some <strong>metadata</strong>
whose information varies between different types of keys, for example, in the
case of keyrings the metadata shows the number of links contained in them and
in the case of user keys, it indicates their size in bytes.</p>
<p>
With the information we extract from the <code>/proc/keys</code> file we are good to go and
try to dump all the keys. My approach in this case was to just read
<code>/proc/keys</code> and try to dump all the keys listed, which is quite easier than
trying to read the permissions and guess which keys can be dumped.</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding, while I think a brute-force approach is a good decision for
reading keys of a process, if we want to read an specific key, trying to inject
in all the processes (and threads) of the system until we read it may not be a
good option, so being able to understand the permissions of a key may
facilitate us to know what process infect.</p>
<p>
As we have say previously, the permissions are formed by four sets, and for each
set we have the following permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>view</strong> (0x01): Allows to read the key attributes. The keys for which the
process has view permissions are the ones listed in <code>/proc/keys</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>read</strong> (0x02): Allows to read the payload. However, some key types such as
&#34;logon&#34; and &#34;asymmetric&#34; don&#39;t support the read operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>write</strong> (0x04): Allows to update the payload and revoke the key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>search</strong> (0x08): Allows the key to be found by a search, that is looking
for a key through the keyrings by its type and description/name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>link</strong> (0x10): Allows to create new links that point to the key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>setattr</strong> (0x20): Allows to revoke the key, update the permissions mask
and the uid (user id) and gid (group id), setting a key timeout and apply a
restrictions to keyrings (implies that keys added to them must be signed).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the four permissions sets are possessor, user, group and others. As we
imagine, the user and group apply to the key user and group owners, and the
other to any other user. </p>
<p>
Let&#39;s see an example of a <code>/proc/keys</code> line:</p>
<figure>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">0ae2c7d1 I--Q---     1 perm 3f010000  1000  1000 user      user_secret: 6</code></pre></div>
</div>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
We can see that permissions for the <code>user_secret</code> key are <code>3f010000</code>, which
means that all the permissions are granted to the possessor, just view
permissions to the user and no permissions for group or others.</p>
<p>
Besides, we must keep in mind that, the same as files, the <strong>user, group and
others permissions are exclusive</strong>, this means that if the user of the process
trying to access the key match with the user key, the user permissions will be
applied, and no group or other permissions, even if these (for some curious
reason) are more permissive than those of the user. Same caso for group
permissions. And in case there is no match for process user or groups, then the
other permissions will apply.</p>
<p>
On the other hand we have the <strong>possessor permissions</strong>, which are quite important
cause generally the possessors are granted the highest privileges in a key. But
possessor permissions are different in several aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Are inclusive</strong>: Possessor permissions are applied together with the one of
other three permissions sets that applies. This means that if, for example,
a process can be applied both user and possessor permissions and the user
permissions only allow to read a key, and the possessor permissions only allow
to write the key, the process can both read and write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are dynamic</strong>: Possessor permissions are applied only if a key is possessed by
the current process (or thread), and key possession is calculated each time
the key is accessed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how can we know if a key is possessed by a process? We need to follow the links
from the anchor keyrings.</p>
<p>
Wonderful, that reveals another question, <strong>what are the anchor keyrings?</strong> If you
recall, I have said that every key, even keyrings, needs to be referenced at
least once in order to not be deleted by the kernel. In fact, each time a key is
created (with <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/add_key.2.html">add_key</a> syscall) a keyring must be specified to contain a link to
that key (same situation in files, as each one must be created under a
folder). Now imagine we want to create our first keyring which will hold links
to all our keys, what keyring will point to our first keyring? The answer is an
<a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/keyrings.7.en#Anchoring_keys">anchor keyring</a>. <strong>Anchor keyrings are special keyrings linked by kernel
structs</strong>. And there are several, that in conjunction with the key possession,
allows keys to only be accessed from specific scopes.</p>
<p>
These are the available anchor keyrings (that are generally created by the
kernel when they are accessed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process keyrings</strong>: These keyrings are linked to the process
credentials. There are three of them with different scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/thread-keyring.7.html">thread-keyring</a>: Only can be accessed by the current thread. It has the name
<em>_tid</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/process-keyring.7.html">process-keyring</a>: Can be accessed by all the threads of the current
process. It has the name <em>_pid</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/session-keyring.7.html">session-keyring</a>: Can be accessed by all the processes in the current login
session (since it is created by <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/pam">PAM</a>). It has the name <em>_ses</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User keyrings</strong>: This keyrings are tied to kernel user structures, so they
only can be used while the user has an active session.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user-keyring.7.html">user-keyring</a>: Can be accessed by all the processes of the user. It has the
name <em>_uid.&lt;uid&gt;</em> where &lt;uid&gt; is replaced by the user uid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user-session-keyring.7.html">user-session-keyring</a>: Can be accessed by all the processes of the user and
it is used in case the session keyring is not created. It has the name
<em>_uid_ses.&lt;uid&gt;</em> where &lt;uid&gt; is replaced by the user uid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/persistent-keyring.7.html">Persistent keyring</a>: Can be accessed by all processes of the user, but it is
not destroyec when the user logs out, so it is intended to be accessed by
background services that acts on behalf on an user. It has an expiration
timeout, so if its not used in a while it is deleted. It has the name
<em>_persistent.&lt;uid&gt;</em> where &lt;uid&gt; is replaced by the user uid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So these are the anchor keyrings we have in a system. They are similar to a root
directory in a filesystem, specially the process keyrings, that are the ones
used in possession.</p>
<p>
So <strong>what it is possession</strong>? and how is calculated? The answer is that a key is
possessed when it is granted <em>search</em> permission and can be accessed by
traversing down the keyrings links starting by the thread-keyring,
process-keyring, or session-keyring. You can check the algorithm in
<a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/keyrings.7.en#Possession">Possession section of keyrings(7)</a>.</p>

<p>
So, now we know what keys are and we are aware that some keys are only
accessible by a process or thread, we need a way to extract them. I can think of
two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Executing some code in the context of the process (or thread) with access to a
target key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading the keys with a Linux module from kernel space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I choose the first option since it was easier to me cause I&#39;m not familiar with
Linux modules programming (but it is a nice project for the future).</p>
<p>
Therefore, to execute some code in other process we can act as a debugger and
inject a shellcode into that process. I&#39;m assuming we have root privileges, so
we can trace any process with the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace</a> syscall (unles the system is hardened).</p>

Basically, these are the steps I follow in keydump for injection a shellcode
into a target process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attach to the target process</p>

<li>
<p>Look for a syscall instruction</p>

<p>
In next steps we require to call an mmap syscall in order to allocate memory for
the shellcode. In order to do that we need to redirect the execution of the
program to a syscall instruction by setting the syscall instruction address in
the the program counter, which is the <code>rip</code> register in x64. </p>
<p>
Therefore we need to find a syscall instruction inside the process memory. Since
usually after tracing a process this is stopped when calling a syscall I&#39;m going
to check if that is the case and store the syscall instruction address. In other
case my program failed, but a memory scanning could be implemented for searching
for a syscall instruction, or we could resume the process execution until a
syscall is executed (can be done with <code>PTRACE_SYSCALL</code>).</p>

<p>
In order to perform an <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap syscall</a>, we need to set the <code>rip</code> registry pointing to
the syscall instruction we have found and passing the arguments to
mmap by setting them in the proper registers which are <code>rdi</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdx</code>,
<code>r10</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>. Notice that we need to
reserve a memory section which allows us to write and execute (and read) for
writing and executing the shellcode (besides, in this case our shellcode also
require these permission for proper execution). </p>
<p>
However, before setting the registers, we need to save the register original
values to restore then afterwards. Once this is done, we execute the syscall
instruction by just performing a single-step operation which only executes one
instruction (the syscall instruction). Then we retrieve the value returned by
the mmap syscall, stored in <code>rax</code> registry, and restore the registers to their
original values to avoid disrupting the target process.</p>

As result of the mmap syscall, we have reserved a memory region to

<p>
In order to call the shellcode we simply need to set into the <code>rip</code> register the
address to which we just have copied the shellcode. Besides, since we want to
restore the real execution flow of the process once our shellcode finish its
job, we insert into the stack as return value the address where the process was
stopped.</p>
<p>
You may notice the <code class="verbatim">rip_offset</code> variable, what is this? When the target process
is interrupted by the ptrace attach, it can be in the middle of a syscall. In
this case, the <code>rip</code> register points to the syscall next instruction, but the
process needs to be resumed in the syscall instruction to repeat it (since it
wasn&#39;t completed) and avoid an unexpected behavior. This is precisely what
happens when the debugger detaches from the process (PTRACE_DETACH operation),
that the <code>rip</code> is subtracted 2 (the syscall instruction size in x64) so no
problems arise. And to handle this (not so) special situation I have introduced
the <code class="verbatim">rip_offset</code> variable whose value is 2 when the target process is stopped
while calling a syscall.</p>
<p>
Thus, I indicate that the address of the shellcode is the allocated address
(with mmap) plus the offset that will be subtracted when we will detach from the
target process. Furthermore the return address could be the instruction pointed
by <code>rip</code> when the process was stopped, or in the case of the situation
previously described, the previous syscall instruction, so 2 must be subtracted
from <code>rip</code>.</p>
<p>
To sum up, we are simulating a <code class="verbatim">call</code> instruction to invoke our shellcode (it is
important to notice that it is responsibility of the shellcode, once done, to
restore the values of the registers so the target process don&#39;t crash). Then,
when the returned address is pushed to the stack and <code>rip</code> points to our
shellcode address, we just detach from the target process. When this happens,
the target process is resumed, executing our shellcode and finally returning to
its normal execution flow.</p>

Once the shellcode is injected into the target process, it will create a folder
under the <code class="verbatim">/tmp/</code> directory which will contain files with the value of the
target process readable keys. Therefore, after injecting the shellcode, we wait
for a little period of time and check if such folder was created.</p>

Attacking SSSD

<p>
Now that we understand the underlying mechanism, it is time for performing the
actual attack, for which is required to have a domain joined GNU/Linux machine
through sssd. I&#39;m not going to describe the process here since many tutorials
exists on the internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://hackliza.gal/en/posts/linux-en-ad/">How to join Debian to Active Directory</a></p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-active-directory">How to join a Linux system to an Active Directory domain</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After setting up the lab you must be able to log with ssh into the target
machine with domain credentials. Like this:</p>
<div class="src src-text">

</div>
<p>
I have used the <code>Administrator</code> account of my domain <code>dev.lab</code> but you can use
any account of the domain.</p>
<p>
Once you have verified that it is possible to access by ssh to the machine with
a domain account, you need to verify that the <code>krb5_store_password_if_offline</code>
option is set to <code>true</code> in your sssd configuration (in domain settings), which is the
default value:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ sudo cat /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

[sssd]
domains = dev.lab
config_file_version = 2
services = nss, pam

[domain/dev.lab]
default_shell = /bin/bash
krb5_store_password_if_offline = True
cache_credentials = True
krb5_realm = DEV.LAB
realmd_tags = manages-system joined-with-adcli 
id_provider = ad
fallback_homedir = /home/%u@%d
ad_domain = dev.lab
use_fully_qualified_names = True
ldap_id_mapping = True
access_provider = ad</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
In case <code>krb5_store_password_if_offline</code> is not present or setting to <code>false</code>,
modify the file and set it to <code>true</code>. Then restart the sssd daemon.</p>
<p>
Once this is done, disconnect the GNU/Linux machine from the Domain
Controller. For this you can just turn off the Domain Controller.</p>
<p>
Now you will need to access to the machine with two accounts simultaneously: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A domain account that will be the victim </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A privileged account like root, one with sudo or any user with the
<code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> capability, that will be the attacker. This account can be
local or from the domain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Be aware that the domains account you will use are required to login at least
once before the Domain Controller is disconnected in order their credentials
(hashes) to be cached into the GNU/Linux machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You may access first with the domain/victim account using ssh:</p>
<div class="src src-text">

</div>
<p>
You won&#39;t need to use this account anymore, just keep its terminal connected in
the background.</p>
<p>
Now, copy the keydump binary to the target machine (by using scp for
example). You will be required to compile it in a machine with similar
characteristics (or in the target machine directly) to avoid glibc version
problems.</p>
<p>
Then, in another terminal, access by using the privileged account, the attacker:</p>
<div class="src src-text">

user@debian:~$</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Then, as attackers, we can confirm there is another user logged with the <code>who</code>
command:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">user@debian:~$ who

administrator@dev.lab pts/1        Jul 28 16:46 (192.168.122.254)</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
And verify that a key that contains the victim password was created:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">user@debian:~$ sudo cat /proc/keys | grep dev.lab
10bfb037 I--Q---     1 perm 3f010000     0     0 user      Administrator@dev.lab: 10</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
As we can see, a key was created with the name of the victim account to store
its password, but we don&#39;t have permissions for reading, only the possessor
processes can. We can verify this with the <code>keyctl</code> command (which must be installed):</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">user@debian:~$ sudo keyctl read 0x10bfb037
keyctl_read_alloc: Permission denied</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
Fortunately, we can use keydump to dump keys of the sssd process by passing it
its pid with the following command:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">user@debian:~$ ps -o pid --no-headers -C sssd | sed &#39;s/ //g&#39; | sudo ./keydump -
[PID 452] Shellcode injected
[PID 452] /tmp/k_452 exists, so keys must be dumped!!
user@debian:~$ sudo cat /tmp/k_452/10bfb037_user_Administrator_dev_lab__10
S3cur3p4ss</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
And success!! We were able to dump the sssd keys and retrieve the victim
password.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-prevention" class="outline-2">

Prevention
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-prevention" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Preventing this attack requires no allowing processes to attach to others, which
can be done with the following command:</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
This configures the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.html">Yama</a> security module to block ptrace (which also prevents
reading files like <code class="verbatim">/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/mem</code> and <code class="verbatim">/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</code>). I think it should
be also possible preventing this attack by using SELinux or Apparmor, but I
don&#39;t know how to do it.</p>

<div id="outline-text-conclusion" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
In this article I have shown how SSSD stores passwords when the Domain
Controller is not available, how keyrings works and how we can dump keys of
other processes with keydump. I hope you enjoy reading it and find it useful.</p>

Happy hacking and Free Palestine!!</p>
