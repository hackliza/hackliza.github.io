Hi people, in this article I'm going to show how to join a GNU/Linux machine,
specifically a Debian one, to an Active Directory environment.I know, I know,
Active Directory (AD) is a commercial tool from the evil Microsoft, but we need
to admit that is the most used tool in the market.

However, not because we are in a Microsoft environment we need to use Windows,
even if that's what they would like. So, in this post I'm going to describe how
GNU/Linux can be joined to Active Directory. Same principles should be applied
when using other directory services, like [[https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page][FreeIPA]] or a pure [[https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP][LDAP]] service.

I would like you to note that I'm going to use examples from my lab domain, so
you will need to adapt them in order to your environment. This is my data:

- Domain: ~dev.lab~
- Domain Administrator: ~Administrator~
- Domain Controller: ~dc01.dev.lab~ - ~192.168.122.135~

Once we are aware of this, let's go to the topic.

* Resolving domain with DNS
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: resolving-domain-with-dns
:END:

First thing on the list is to be able to resolve our domain by using
DNS. Therefore, our easier option is to establish as DNS server our Domain
Controller (DC), which is the machine were the directory database is stored and
the one that provides the services for the directory, like DNS.

#+begin_quote
There can be several Domain Controllers in an Active Directory environment, but
pick one of them as our DNS server is enough. Maybe two in case you want a
backup DNS server.
#+end_quote

My DC IP is ~192.168.122.135~. First, I want check that I have conectivity to
it, with a ping command (in case we want to be extrasure, we can use [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc][netcat]] or
[[https://nmap.org/][nmap]] to check we can reach the 53/UDP port, used by DNS):
#+caption: Ping to Domain Controller
#+begin_src
$ ping -c4 192.168.122.135
PING 192.168.122.135 (192.168.122.135) 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.563/0.616/0.659/0.037 ms
#+end_src

Once we are sure we can connect, we must add the DC as DNS server. In my case
I'm going to add it to the [[https://linux.die.net/man/5/dhclient.conf][/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf]] file so [[https://linux.die.net/man/8/dhclient][dhclient]] will include
it into [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/resolv.conf.5.html][/etc/resolv.conf]], which is the file used by GNU/Linux (specifically by
the [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/libc.7.html][libc]]) to retrieve the DNS servers.

#+begin_quote
Maybe in your case ~dhclient~ is not on charge of DNS configuration, so you need
to discover which program is. The usual alternatives are NetworkManager and
systemd-resolved. You can check our article [[https://hackliza.gal/en/posts/cambiar_dns_linux/][Who is messing with my DNS?]] to
properly configure your DNS.
#+end_quote

The commands to add my DC as DNS server would be the following:
#+caption: Setting Domain Controller as DNS server
#+begin_src
$ echo "prepend domain-name-servers 192.168.122.135;" | sudo tee -a /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
prepend domain-name-servers 192.168.122.135;
#+end_src

Besides in order to make easier to find domain machines, I want that when I
specified a hostname, it is searched inside my domain. Therefore, I'm going to
add my domain as the default to search for in case I introduce a machine name
without the domain part:
#+caption: Setting my domain as the default for searchs
#+begin_src
$ echo 'prepend domain-search "dev.lab";' | sudo tee -a /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
prepend domain-search "dev.lab";
#+end_src

And finally we restart the service so the new configuration is applied:
#+caption: Network daemon reboot
#+begin_src
$ sudo systemctl restart ifup@enp1s0.service
#+end_src

Be aware the ~ifup~ service, that spawns ~dhclient~, is given the network
interface as a parameter, which is ~enp1s0~ in my case, but it may differ in
your machine.

Next, we can try to resolve our domain to be sure our DC was properly included
as DNS server:
#+caption: DNS resolution of our domain
#+begin_src 
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
search dev.lab.
nameserver 192.168.122.135
nameserver 192.168.122.1
$ host dev.lab
dev.lab has address 192.168.122.135
#+end_src

We also check that the domain machine names is resolved even if we don't specify
the domain part:
#+caption: Machine names DNS resolution
#+begin_src
$ host dc01.dev.lab
dc01.dev.lab has address 192.168.122.135
$ host dc01
dc01.dev.lab has address 192.168.122.135
#+end_src

* A bit of theory: The connection components
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: a-bit-of-theory-the-connection-components
:END:

Now we got conectivity with the domain, we need to install all the libraries and
tools that implement the different protocols that allow our machine to interact
with the Domain Controllers.

However, before install them, I would like to share a bit of theory, so we can
understand the different parts that are involved in the Active Directory
integration.

** Active Directory protocols
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: active-directory-protocols
:END:

*** DNS
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: dns
:END:

We already mess with this one. [[https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System][DNS]] (Domain Name System) is a very important
protocol used to get the IPs of the domain machines. For our domain, the main
DNS authority are the Domain Controllers.

Any tool we use will resolve the DNS names without us to worry about it, but in
case we want to explicitly get the IP of a machine, we can use utilities like
[[https://linux.die.net/man/1/host][host]], [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/nslookup][nslookup]] or [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig][dig]]:

#+caption: Domain machines name resolution
#+begin_src
$ host dc01.dev.lab
dc01.dev.lab has address 192.168.122.135
#+end_src

*** Kerberos
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: kerberos
:END:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)][Kerberos]] is an protocol for remote authentication. It is based in tokens called
*tickets*, that the Domain Controller dispenses when an user authenticates with
her username and password. Afterwards, tickets can be presented to other domain
machines in order to authenticate the user.

There are two *tickets* types:

- *TGT* (Ticket Granting Ticket): Is the ticket returned to an user when she
  authenticates with her username and password against the Domain Controller. It
  can be used to ask for tickets for the services, known as ST, without typing
  the password again.

#+caption: TGT retrieval
#+begin_example
                                                .---.
    _____                                      /   /|
   |     |   >----Username and password--->   .---. |
   |_____|                                    |   | '
   /:::::/   <--------------TGT-----------<   |   |/ 
  client                                     '---'  
                                                DC
#+end_example

- *ST* (Service Ticket): Is a ticket for an specific service, like SMB (also
  known as CIFS) or LDAP. The ST is retrieved from the Domain Controller when a
  TGT is presented.

#+caption: ST retrieval and use
#+begin_example
                                          .---.

   |     |   >----------TGT--------->   .---. |
   |_____|                              |   | '
   /:::::/   <------ST for CIFS-----<   |   |/ 
  client                               '---'  
    ^  v                                 DC
    |  |
    |  |                          .---. 
    |  '-----ST for CIFS------>  /   /|                                          
    |                           .---. | 
    '-------shared folder-----< |   | '                                          
                                |   |/  
                                '---'   
                            SMB/CIFS server
#+end_example


Tickets are used to avoid users being constantly asked by their passwords, which
can be annoying, every time a new connection to a machine is made. Besides,
tickets can include security information for the upper protocols like as if they
must *sign or encrypt* the messages. Lastly, tickets can also include
information about the users, such as the *user groups*, in a struct known as PAC
(Privilege Attribute Certificate).

Kerberos is protocol that is well integrated with other protocolos as SMB or
LDAP, so is not usual to directly interact with it. However, the Debian
~krb5-user~ package includes several tools to request and list our current
tickets, as in the following example:

#+caption: klist listing current session Kerberos tickets
#+begin_src
$ klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1190600500_fwQbdO
Default principal: Administrator@DEV.LAB

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
08/22/2024 20:32:19  08/23/2024 06:32:19  krbtgt/DEV.LAB@DEV.LAB
	renew until 08/23/2024 20:32:19
08/22/2024 20:32:20  08/23/2024 06:32:19  cifs/dc01.dev.lab@
	renew until 08/23/2024 20:32:19
	Ticket server: cifs/dc01.dev.lab@DEV.LAB
#+end_src

In this case we can observe two tickets, the one for ~krbtgt/DEV.LAB@DEV.LAB~
which allow us to know that is a TGT, and the one for ~cifs/dc01.dev.lab~ that
we know is for the SMB/CIFS service which allows an user to access shared
folders in the remote system. Knowing the tickets in our current session can
useful for troubleshooting.

*** LDAP
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: ldap
:END:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol][LDAP]] is a commonly used protocol in directory services. It allows to query the
directory database so you can retrieve and modify the entities, like users or
computers. You may think of LDAP as the SQL of directory services.

In the specific case of Active Directory, LDAP uses Kerberos under the hood to
authenticate users when a new connection with the Domain Controller is
established.

The open source implementation of LDAP is OpenLDAP, which is included in the
~libldap-<version>~ package, which is a dependency for many other packages
related with the protocol. In addition, if we want to query the directory
database, we can use tools like ~ldapsearch~ from the ~ldap-utils~ package.

Here is an example of domain computers enumeration:

#+caption: Listing domain computers with ldapsearch
#+begin_src
$ ldapsearch -H ldap://dc01.dev.lab -b 'DC=dev,DC=lab'  '(objectClass=computer)' name 2>/dev/null | grep name:
name: DC01
name: DEBIAN12
#+end_src

*** Samba/SMB
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: samba-smb
:END:

[[https://linux.die.net/man/7/samba][Samba]] is the free implementation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block][SMB]], which is a common protocol to share
folders in Windows environments, including Active Directory.

#+begin_quote
Apart from SMB, it is common to use the name CIFS to refer to the same protocol,
even if CIFS was a previous protocol of SMB (same situation as SSL and
TLS). Actually, the SMB service of Active Directory is called CIFS.
#+end_quote

As I mentioned previously, SMB uses Kerberos under the hood as authentication
protocol, and in the same way as LDAP, it sends a ticket when a new connection
is established with the target server.

In the case of Debian, the ~samba-tools~ package contains the required tools and
libraries to communicate with SMB as a client. For instance, we can use
~smbclient~ to list shared folders in servers of a domain:

#+caption: Listing SMB shared folders from a remote server with smbclient
#+begin_src
$ smbclient --use-krb5-ccache=$KRB5CCNAME -L dc01.dev.lab

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
	SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
#+end_src

** Tools for GNU/Linux integration in Active Directory
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: tools-for-gnulinux-integration-in-active-directory
:END:

Once we have seen the protocols, lets review some key tools and components for
integrating GNU/Linux in Active Directory.

*** PAM
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: pam
:END:

[[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam.8.html][PAM]] (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a set of GNU/Linux libraries that
allows to integrate several authentication mechanisms. Programs that require
authenticate system users, like SSH or [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/login.1.html][login]], can use PAM to benefit from all
these authentication mechanisms, like passwords, pins, certificates, etc, with
little effort.

#+begin_quote
Curiosity: SSH keys are not part of PAM, but an authentication mechanism of SSH
itself.
#+end_quote

PAM allows both local authentication, like checking passwords in [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/shadow.5.html][/etc/shadow]],
and remote authentication, by using protocols like Kerberos (through sssd as we
will see later).

Besides, PAM also allow other actions like changing user passwords, setting the
environment variables or mounting user directory when a user logs in.

We can check the files in the ~/etc/pam.d~ folder to see what PAM modules are
being used.

*** NSS
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: nss
:END:

[[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nss.5.html][NSS]] (Name Service Switch) is a mechanism used in GNU/Linux to know where to find
the information related to different system items, like users or domain
names. In this regard the configuration file [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html][/etc/nsswitch.conf]] is used as
reference.

For example, when an application wants to get information about an user,
nsswitch is read to know what are the data sources, like the [[https://linux.die.net/man/5/passwd][/etc/passwd]] local
file or the sssd service.

#+caption: Usernames sources configuration
#+begin_src
$ cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep passwd
passwd:         files systemd sss
#+end_src

Another common case are the domain names, where nsswitch indicates that
information must be retrieved first from [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/hosts.5.html][/etc/hosts]], and if it is missed in the
file, from a DNS requests.

#+caption: Domain names resolution configuration
#+begin_src
$ cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep hosts
hosts:          files dns
#+end_src

*** sssd
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: sssd
:END:

[[https://linux.die.net/man/8/sssd][sssd]] (System Security Services Daemon) is like the glue that joins all the
previously discussed protocols and programs, since it is a tool that uses many
libraries to interact with directory services like Active Directory or FreeIPA,
allowing their integration with [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam.8.html][PAM]] and [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nss.5.html][NSS]].

The integration would be something like this:
#+caption: sssd integration with the rest of components
#+begin_example
                                             +-----------+

#+end_example

* Joining the machine to the domain
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: joining-the-machine-to-the-domain
:END:

In order to join the machine to the domain we can use the [[https://manpages.org/realm/8][realm]] program, which
configures sssd so we can use it to authenticate domain users.

Here is a summary of the packages we are going to install, so we can understand
the purpose of each one:

- ~sssd~: Installs the sssd daemon and the required modules to communicate with
  directory services.
- ~sssd-tools~: Installs the tools to control sssd, like [[https://man.archlinux.org/man/sssctl.8.en][sssctl]].
- ~libnss-sss~: Installs the NSS library that allows the communication with sssd.
- ~libpam-sss~: Installs the PAM library that allows the communication with sssd.
- ~adcli~: Allows to join the machine to the domain.
- ~realmd~: Allows to join the machine to the domain by using adcli and sets the
  sssd configuration.
- ~pakcagekit~: Tool used by realmd to manage packages.

In order to install the packages we execute the following:
#+caption: Installing required packages to join the domain
#+begin_src
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y sssd sssd-tools adcli libnss-sss libpam-sss realmd packagekit
#+end_src

Once the packages are installed, we can continue and join our machine to the
domain. We can do this with any domain user or just with administrator accounts
depending on the domain configuration. In my case I will do it with my
Administrator account:

#+caption: Command to join a machine to the domain
#+begin_src
sudo realm join --user=Administrator dev.lab
#+end_src

If everything goes well the command should only ask for the user password and no
more output should be produced. Afterwards, we can verify we have joined the
domain with ~sssctl~ or ~realm~:
#+caption: sssctl and realm showing the current domain
#+begin_src
$ sudo sssctl domain-list
dev.lab
$ sudo realm list
dev.lab
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: DEV.LAB
  domain-name: dev.lab
  configured: kerberos-member
  server-software: active-directory
  client-software: sssd
  required-package: sssd-tools
  required-package: sssd
  required-package: libnss-sss
  required-package: libpam-sss
  required-package: adcli
  required-package: samba-common-bin
  login-formats: %U@dev.lab
  login-policy: allow-realm-logins
#+end_src

Then we need to configure PAM to use sssd as a mechanism to authenticate
users. We need to execute ~pam-auth-update~ and select "SSS
authentication". Besides, if we want to create a home directory for domain
users, we also need to select "Create home directory on login":
#+begin_src
$ sudo pam-auth-update
#+end_src

Our configuration should be something like this:

#+caption: pam-auth-update to use sss and creating home directory
[[./pam-update-screenshot.png]]

When this is done we should be able to login with domain users in our
machine. We can test this with SSH:
#+caption: Domain user login with ssh
#+begin_src
$ ssh Administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12
Administrator@dev.lab@192.168.122.165's password:

administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$
#+end_src

And we finally can login with domain users!! This should be enough for the most
basic environments, but you can keep reading since I'm going to configure a few
more things.

* Authentication with the domain username, without the domain
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: authentication-with-the-domain-username-without-the-domain
:END:

A very comfortable thing we can do is to configure sssd so we don't need to
specify the domain when we login with a domain user. So instead of writing
"Administrator@dev.lab" we can just type "Administrator". In case of using SSH,
instead of using the following form:

#+begin_src
$ ssh Administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12
#+end_src

We could use just the username:

#+begin_src
$ ssh Administrator@lab-debian12
#+end_src


In order to do this we must configure sssd to use the domain as suffix for the
users. We can do this adding a ~default_domain_suffix~ statement in
~/etc/sssd/sssd.conf~ like the next:

#+caption: sssd.conf with default_domain_suffix
#+begin_src
$ sudo head -6 /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

[sssd]
domains = dev.lab
config_file_version = 2
services = nss, pam
default_domain_suffix = dev.lab
#+end_src

Then we restart ~sssd~:
#+begin_src
sudo systemctl restart sssd
#+end_src

And now we should be able to login by only specifying the username:
#+begin_src
$ ssh Administrator@lab-debian12
Administrator@192.168.122.165's password: 
Linux debian12-base 6.1.0-23-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.99-1 (2024-07-15) x86_64

Last login: Sun Aug 18 18:07:39 2024 from 192.168.122.137
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$
#+end_src

Perfect!! Now we can afford 2 seconds of typing and use as we wish. Not much,
but it's a start.

* Integrating domain groups with sudo
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: integrating-domain-groups-with-sudo
:END:

Another interesting thing is to use *sudo* with domain users. I would like to
replicate the "Domain Admins" group behavior in Windows machine, where those are
included as local administrators. In GNU/Linux to achieve a similar effect we
can grant sudo to the "Domain Admins" group.

In order to do this we can add a rule like the following in ~/etc/sudoers~:
#+begin_src
$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers | grep domain
"%domain admins@dev.lab" ALL=(ALL) ALL
#+end_src

Once this rule is added, we should be able to execute ~sudo~ with the
~Administrator~ user:
#+begin_src
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ sudo id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
#+end_src

Another way to get the sudo rules, in addition to read ~/etc/sudoers~, is to
retrieve them from the Domain Controller. This process is carried by sssd so we
need to install the ~libsss-sudo~ package:
#+caption: libsss-sudo installation
#+begin_src
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libsss-sudo
#+end_src

After the installation we can see that ~/etc/nsswitch.conf~ file shows sss as a
provider for sudoers:
#+caption: nss configuration for sudo rules
#+begin_src
$ cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep sudoers
sudoers: files  sss
#+end_src

On the other hand, we have to configure ~sssd~ so it uses the sudo module. We
can do this by adding ~sudo~ into the ~services~ statement of
~/etc/sssd/sssd.conf~. 
#+caption: sssd configured to use sudo
#+begin_src
$ sudo cat /etc/sssd/sssd.conf | grep services
services = nss, pam, sudo
#+end_src

By using this configuration ~sssd~ will look for sudo rules in Active Directory
database (with LDAP). Therefore, the rules you want to introduce into sudo must
be written into Active Directory database, but how to do that is out of this
article scope. However you can check the following post to do it (I didn't
tested it):

* Mounting shared folders into the system
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: mounting-shared-folders-into-the-system
:END:

Other thing that can be useful when joining a machine to a domain is being able
to mount shared folders, by using SMB, that can be found in domain servers (and
in some personal computers).

Let's review some tools that can be useful in different situations.

** Exploring shared folders with smbclient
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: exploring-shared-folders-with-smbclient
:END:

One of our options it to use ~smbclient~, the console client of Samba. First
thing to do is installing it:
#+caption: smbclient installation
#+begin_src
sudo apt install smbclient
#+end_src

Once it's installed, we need to indicate our domain into the
~/etc/samba/smb.conf~ file. In order to make it work into my domain, I have used
the following options:
#+caption: /etc/samba/smb.conf configuration
#+begin_src
workgroup = DEV
client signing = yes
realm = DEV.LAB
#+end_src

In order to give you some context, this is the meaning of each option:

- workgroup: It is the domain name in NetBIOS format, which is a protocolo used,
  among other things, to resolve machine IP addresses in the local network. In
  order to get the netbios name of our domain we can use
  ~ldapsearch -LLL -H ldap://dc01.dev.lab -b 'DC=dev,DC=lab'
  '(objectClass=domain)' name 2>/dev/null | grep name:~, but remember that you
  need to specify the domain name in uppercase in the Samba configuration.
- realm: The domain name in DNS format.
- client signing: To enable packets signatures.

Even if smbclient can use Kerberos, I wasn't able to make it to use my tickets
by default. When I execute it, asks me for the user password:
#+caption: smbclient asking for password
#+begin_src
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ smbclient -L dc01.dev.lab
Password for [Administrator@DEV.LAB]:
#+end_src

I needed to specify the ~--use-krb5-ccache=$KRB5CCNAME~ to make it use my
Kerberos tickets (the ~$KRB5CCNAME~ contains the path to the file containing the
Kerberos tickets). So, in order to make easier to use ~smbclient~ with Kerberos
tickets we can create the following alias: 
#+caption: smbclient alias to use Kerberos tickets
#+begin_src
alias smbclient='smbclient --use-krb5-ccache=$KRB5CCNAME'
#+end_src

This way smbclient will use Kerberos tickets by default, but I not going to use
the alias in the following examples in order to make them more didactic.

The point is that we can execute ~smbclient~ in the following way to list the
shares in a remote server:
#+caption: remote server shared folders listing
#+begin_src
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ smbclient --use-krb5-ccache=$KRB5CCNAME -L dc01.dev.lab

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
	SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
#+end_src

Once we know the remote shared folders, we can can also explore them with
~smbclient~:
#+caption: SYSVOL folder exploration
#+begin_src
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ smbclient --use-krb5-ccache=$KRB5CCNAME \\\\dc01.dev.lab\\SYSVOL
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Mon Sep 25 10:23:21 2023
  ..                                  D        0  Mon Sep 25 10:23:21 2023
  dev.lab                            Dr        0  Mon Sep 25 10:23:21 2023

		18221567 blocks of size 4096. 12979219 blocks available
#+end_src

This should give you an idea of when to use smbclient, but you may prefer other
options such as mounting the remote folder in the local filesystem. We will
explore some alternatives, but before I would like to share an error that I
encountered in my tests:
#+caption: smbclient error
#+begin_src
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ smbclient -L dc01.dev.lab --use-krb5-ccache=$KRB5CCNAME
gse_get_client_auth_token: gss_init_sec_context failed with [ Miscellaneous failure (see text): FAST fast response is missing FX-FAST (cifs/dc01.dev.lab@DEV.LAB)](2529639059)
gensec_spnego_client_negTokenInit_step: gse_krb5: creating NEG_TOKEN_INIT for cifs/dc01.dev.lab failed (next[(null)]): NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
#+end_src

The error message is misleading, since in my case it wasn't an error related
to FAST, but an error in clock synchronization between my machine and the
Domain Controller (which dispenses the Kerberos tickets). Once the clock was
adjust, everything works perfectly.


** Mounting shared folders with mount
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: mounting-shared-folder-with-mount
:END:

Even if it's nice to explore shared folders with ~smbclient~, usually we want to
work with them as if they were local folders. In this case we need to mount them
in our filesystem by using [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html][mount]]. However, we need to install the following
package in order to make it work with SMB (also known as CIFS):
#+caption: Installing a package to use SMB in mount
#+begin_src
sudo apt install cifs-utils
#+end_src

The ~cifs-utils~ package allows ~mount~ to know how to mount SMB shared
folders. If we combine this with the ~-o sec=krb5~ option that allows to use
Kerberos, we can mount remote shared folders as easy as in the following
example:

#+caption: Mounting the SYSVOL shared folder in /tmp/SYSVOL
#+begin_src
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ mkdir /tmp/SYSVOL
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ sudo mount -t cifs -o sec=krb5 //dc01.dev.lab/SYSVOL /tmp/SYSVOL/
administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ ls /tmp/SYSVOL/
dev.lab
#+end_src

And there it is, our shared folder mounted!! And remember that [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html][mount]] allows to
specify options for the mount points that allows to make them read only,
disabling binary execution, etc. You can check the options in [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html][mount(8)]].

** Mounting shared folders with pam_mount
:PROPERTIES:
:custom_id: mounting-shared-folders-with-pam_mount
:END:

Mounting shared folders with ~mount~ is nice, but sometimes it is better to
mount them when an user logs in. For this purpose, we can use the PAM
~libpam-mount~ module, which can be installed with the following command:

#+caption: Instalación do módulo de carpetas compartidas de PAM
#+begin_src
sudo apt install libpam-mount
#+end_src

After installing the module we need to make sure that PAM is using it. We can
execute the following command to check that:
#+caption: Updating PAM configuration
#+begin_src
sudo pam-auth-update
#+end_src

We must check that the "Mount volumes" option is selected.

Once we got ~libpam-mount~, we can add shared folders to mount in the
~/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml~ file. To do this we must add a ~volume~
element like the following:
#+caption: Volume configuration for libpam-mount
#+begin_src xml
<volume fstype="cifs" 
	sgrp="domain users@dev.lab"
	server="dc01.dev.lab"
	path="SYSVOL"
	mountpoint="~/SYSVOL"
	options="vers=3.0,sec=krb5,cruid=%(USERUID),noexec,rw,nosuid,nodev"
	/>
#+end_src

Here we indicate that members of ~domain users~ group of ~dev.lab~ domain are
going to mount the ~SYSVOL~ shared folder in their home directory. Moreover, the
~options~ field indicates the ~mount~ options. And it is important to remark
that ~volume~ elements should be after the ~debug~ element, which is helpful if
you have to debug something (as it was my case).

And now we can login with an user belonging to the specified group and the
shared folder should be mounted automatically:

#+caption: Mounting shared folder when user logs in
#+begin_src
user@debdev:~$ ssh Administrator@lab-debian12 
Administrator@192.168.122.165's password: 
Linux lab-debian12 6.1.0-23-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.99-1 (2024-07-15) x86_64

administrator@dev.lab@lab-debian12:~$ ls SYSVOL/
dev.lab
#+end_src

And there it is our shared folder mounted!!

However, before we finish, I'm going to share an issue I had with the hope of
this knowledge being helpful. I wasn't able to mount the shared folder at first,
so I enable the debug option with ~<debug enable="1"/>~, which should be at the
top of the configuration. Once the debug is enabled, ~pam_mount~ will show debug
messages that we can see in the service output:
#+begin_src

Aug 18 12:31:34 lab-debian12 sshd[8070]: (pam_mount.c:660): done opening session (ret=0)
#+end_src

We can appreciate the ~(pam_mount.c:629): no volumes to mount~ error that in my
case was given cause in my volume options I had specified ~sgrp="domain users"~
instead of ~sgrp="domain users@dev.lab"~. This error made the group not being
recognized. Once the option was modified for the correct one everything worked
fine.
